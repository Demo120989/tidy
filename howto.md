# How To

## Setup

- Install Yeoman and the Yeoman generator for Office add-ins with `npm install -g yo generator-office`
- Create the add-in project with `yo office`
- Optional: Open the new folder in VS code and install the recommended extensions (possibly disable ESLint as it gives error messages)
- Update the packages with `npm update`
- Install styled components with `npm install --save styled-components`
- Run `npm i --save-dev @types/styled-components`
