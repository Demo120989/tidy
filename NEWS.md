# Change log

## tidystats Word add-in 1.1

### Meta

- Adapted the add-in to use the new tidystats structure from the tidystats R package v0.6
- Adapted the code to use React rather than my own spaghetti code; this was super cool to figure out and it really improved how the add-in works under the hood!

### Features

- The add-in now preserves the state after closing the taskpane window. This means you don't have to re-upload the statistics file each time you close the add-in.
- You can now insert tables!

### GUI

- Added a navigation bar to more easily switch between entering statistics, performing actions, or seeking support. This means you don't have to scroll all the way down anymore if you have a long list of statistics and you want to update them or cite the software.

## tidystats Word add-in 1.0
